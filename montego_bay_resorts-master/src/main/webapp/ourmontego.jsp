		<h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Montego Bay, Jamacia</h1>
		<p class="lead">This is a brief history about Montego Bay</p>
		<hr class="my-4">
		<p>Montego Bay is the capital of the Parish of St. James and the
			second city in Jamaica. When Columbus sailed into the area in May
			1494, he was the first European visitor. He made friends with some of
			the local Tainos, who called the Bay "El Golfo the Buen Tiempo". The
			Spanish began to settle in Montego Bay after 1510 in the area of the
			Fort and they called the Bay "Bahia de Mantega" because of the large
			quantities of pigs' lard they exported to their colonies in South
			America and the West Indies. With the British occupation of Jamaica
			in 1655, St. James was among the second group of Parishes founded in
			1671. Montego Bay was a small town for the first part of the 18th
			century, and up until 1788 was exempt of taxes, but this soon
			changed.</p>
		<p>Some time after 1720 a Captain Jonathan Barnett sub-divided a
			portion of his sugar cane fields and created Charles Town, with
			Charles Square now called Sam Sharpe Square, and Barnett Town. This
			resulted in the rapid expansion of the town and its commercial
			waterfront, as during this time most trade and communication was by
			sea.</p>
		<p>Fort Montego, which is about half a mile from Montego Bay, was
			built on a small bluff overlooking what was then Meager Bay, and
			River Bay (both these bays have now been filled in for highway and
			town expansion). The Fort was one of many built along the coast to
			protect the major shipping ports of Jamaica from invasion by French
			and Spanish forces and pirates that roamed around the Caribbean Sea.
			In 1752 the Fort was reported to be in very poor condition, and
			historian Edward Long reported that in 1760 one of the guns exploded
			killing the gunner while the Fort was celebrating the British capture
			of Havana. In 1779 the Fort underwent extensive renovations and the
			platform, paving, parapet wall and the powder magazine with its
			buttresses were built. Today you still can find fortresses, Great
			Houses and other remnants of the colonial days.</p>
